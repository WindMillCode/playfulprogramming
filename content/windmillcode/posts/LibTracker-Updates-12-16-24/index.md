Managing dependencies is one of the most critical aspects of modern software development. With LibTracker, our VSCode extension, we’re empowering developers to maintain up-to-date, secure, and compliant applications effortlessly.

View your app's dependencies at a glance, identify outdated versions, fix security vulnerabilities, and address problematic licensing—all in one streamlined tool.

Access LibTracker here: [Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=windmillcode-publisher-0.lib-tracker)

New Features:
- Dependency Insights: Now see the latest available version and the recommended stable version for each dependency. The stable version aligns with your package manager's suggestions, helping you make safe updates without risking app stability.
- Enhanced Usability: Added action icons with tooltips for a more intuitive experience.
- Unused Code Detection: Identify unused packages and imports with ease.
- Edge Case Handling: Improved handling for non-registry packages, ensuring you receive as much information as possible.

Upcoming Enhancements:
- Progress Indicators: Visualize progress for checks like outdated versions, unused dependencies, and pre-fetch operations.
- Collapsible Action Icons: Streamline the interface by collapsing less frequently used tools.
- Advanced Filters: Add glob or regex-based ignore patterns for app subpath searches.
- Git-Based Backups: Explore using Git instead of the filesystem for enhanced backup reliability.
- App Detail Page Improvements:
  - Display CVE information.
  - Advanced search functionality.
  - Responsive design with card-based layouts for better readability.

Future Goals:
- SBOM Generation: Automatically create a comprehensive Software Bill of Materials for your projects.
- License and CVE Summaries: Summarize key insights using URLs or AI-generated categories.
- Subdependency Insights: Enable direct navigation to subdependencies within the license pane.

At Windmillcode, we are committed to helping developers build secure, efficient, and scalable applications. Stay tuned for continuous updates, and let us know how we can further improve LibTracker to meet your needs.
